With the aid of examples explain the rules of Big O notation in algorithm analysis

*Ignore constants* - Coefficients and lower order terms are not relevant for huge inputs. 
    Eg O(n+9)→O(n).
*Drop Non-Dominant Terms* - For combined terms only keep the the highest term.
    Eg. O(n+n2+logn)→O(n2)
*Multiplication for nested loops* - If one loop is running inside another you multiply. 
    Eg O(n*n)=O(n square of 2) 
*• Constant Time Operations* - Simple operations
    Eg O(1)
*Space Complexity* - Always have room for extra memory to be used. Eg for recursion stacks.
