Differentiate between arrays and linked lists in terms of:
 Memory allocation
 Performance
 Insertion and deletion operations


*Memory allocaton*
    -For arrays memory is allocated once while in linked lists it is dynamic
    -In performance, arrays are fast while linked lists are slow due to traversal.
    -Insertion and deletion. For arrays its inefficient if done at the beginning or middle while for linked lists its efficient regardless of how its done as compared to arrays.
